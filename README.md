# Abaqus extract min max curves
Simple script to get min and max results over time

The script runs through the steps and frames (like an animation) and grabs the min and max value from the legend. This is much faster than going to the raw data.

Usage:
- Display contour plot of the variable you want to use
- Run script
- Check XY Data Manager when done

There was no excessive testing. Usage at own risk.
