# Abaqus: Extract min max curves
Simple script for Abaqus/CAE to get min and max result curves over time

The script runs through the steps and frames (like an animation) and grabs the min and max value from the legend. This is much faster than going to the raw data. Afterwards the xy curves are generated from the data.

Usage:
- Display contour plot of the variable you want to use
- Run script
- Check XY Data Manager when done

There was no excessive testing. Usage at your own risk.
